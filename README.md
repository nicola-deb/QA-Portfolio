## RESTful Web Application Project 

**Project Overview: User Account Management System**

The [User Account Management System](https://github.com/nicola-deb/software-testing-portfolio/tree/main/my-user-management-app) is a web application designed to facilitate the management of user accounts using various programming languages, technologies and test tools. <br>

**Key Features** <br>
- **User Management:** Functions to view, create, update, and delete user accounts via a RESTful API.<br>
- **Backend Integration:** Node.js handles server-side logic and communicates with the SQLite database.<br>
- **Database Management:** SQLite provides a lightweight and efficient storage solution for user data.<br>
- **Batch Operations:** Python scripts enable batch addition, updating, or deletion of multiple users, streamlining user 
  management tasks.

**Technologies Used**
<br>
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
- **Backend:** Node.js<br>
- **Database:** SQLite<br>
- **REST API:** Endpoints for adding, updating, viewing, and deleting users.<br>
- **Scripting:** Python for batch user operations.
- **Git:** Version Control

**Testing**
<br>
- **Postman API Testing Tool:** Ensured the REST API endpoints function as intended for the POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests.<br>
- **Python Scripting:** Add/Delete users in batch for quick set-up of environment & performance testing.<br>
- **Cypress & Javascript in Chrome:** To verify the functionality of the UI components & interactions.<br>
- **Selenium & Java in Mozilla:** To be Added <br>
- **Playright & Python:** To be Added <br>
- **JMeter Performance Testing Tool:** To be Added <br>



## UI Automation Testing Project

This is a practical project where I use automation to test login, withdrawal and deposit features of a Banking Web Application as part of a Test Automatinon Course with Dublin Coding School, 2024. 
 
Within the [cypress-script](https://github.com/nicola-deb/software-testing-portfolio/tree/main/Automation_Testing/cypress-script) folder, you will find a test script that uses the Cypress front-end testing tool, based on JavaScript. 

Within the [selenium-script](https://github.com/nicola-deb/software-testing-portfolio/tree/main/Automation_Testing/selenium-script) folder, you will find a test script that uses the Selenium test automation tool, based on Java.
