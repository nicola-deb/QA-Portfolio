## QA Mindset


Quality Assurance isn’t just a set of tools or processes - it’s a mindset that's required for quality assurance to be upheld throughout the Software Development Lifecycle.

I believe a good quality culture and mindset involves the following:

**Automation + Human Expertise**\
Automation testing is a powerful tool, but it doesn’t replace human creativity and intuition. A complementary approach balances automated testing for speed, coverage and efficiency with manual exploratory testing to catch usability and unanticipated issues.

**Continuous Feedback and Learning**\
Rather than focusing on who made a mistake, a blameless and learning-focused culture encourages open feedback, leading to improvements across the board. Developers and testers complement each other’s skills to refine processes.

**Quality as a Shared Responsibility**\
Encouraging early testing in the development lifecycle helps both QA and developers catch issues sooner, reducing rework and increasing efficiency. This fosters a culture where quality is built in.

**Cross-Functional Collaboration**\
Product managers, developers, testers, and even customer support teams can work together to ensure quality from different perspectives. This prevents silos and ensures a holistic approach to software quality.

**Quality as a Business Value, Not a Bottleneck**\
When QA is seen as an enabler of business success, rather than a gatekeeper to delivering on time, it aligns incentives across the company. High-quality software leads to better user experiences, fewer production issues, less cost of fix, and greater customer trust.
