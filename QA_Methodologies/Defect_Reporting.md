## Defect Reporting 

Defect reporting is a critical aspect of Quality Assurance (QA) because it helps ensure software quality, improve efficiency, and enhance user experience. 

I am meticulous and creative in uncovering and troubleshooting risks and problems that matter, no matter where or when they occur in the development process, with the goal to deliver software solutions with high customer value and exceptional user experience. 

**_What makes a good Bug Report?_** 

Although many Defect Management Tools automatically handle the generation of many input fields, we shouldn't take this for granted. 

It is important to understand how to write a bug report that provides meaningful information for the person reviewing it whether that is:

- the Developer analysing the issue and designing the fix.
- the Project Manager who needs to track and/or understand how severely it impacts the product and the project timelines.
- the QA team who can perform Fault-Slip Analysis on the issue to improve testing processes to potentially find similar issues earlier.

**_The ISTQB description of a Bug Report includes:_** 

- Unique identifier 
- Title with a short summary of the anomaly being reported 
- Date when the anomaly was observed, and author, including their role  
- Identification of the test object and test environment 
- Context of the defect (e.g., test case being run, test activity being performed, SDLC phase, and other relevant information such as the test technique, checklist or test data being used) 
- Description of the failure to enable reproduction and resolution including the test steps that detected the anomaly, and any relevant test logs, database dumps, screenshots, or recordings 
- Expected results and actual results 
- Severity of the defect (degree of impact) on the interests of stakeholders or requirements 
- Priority to fix 
- Status of the defect (e.g., open, deferred, duplicate, waiting to be fixed, awaiting confirmation testing, re-opened, closed, rejected) 
- References (e.g., to the test case that revealed the issue)
