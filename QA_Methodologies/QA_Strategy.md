## QA Strategy

A QA strategy is a structured plan that outlines the processes, tools, and methodologies used to ensure software quality. It defines how testing will be conducted to meet business and technical requirements.

- Testing Objectives – What the team aims to achieve (e.g., defect detection, performance validation). <br>
- Test Scope – What will be tested (features, integrations, performance, security). <br>
- Testing Types – Functional, non-functional, automation, regression, security, etc. <br>
- Test Approach – Manual vs. automated testing, risk-based testing, exploratory testing. <br>
- Tools & Environments – Selecting test management tools (e.g., Jira, Selenium, Postman). <br>
- Defect Management – How issues will be reported, tracked, and resolved.<br>
- Test Metrics & Reporting – KPIs to measure effectiveness (e.g., defect density, test coverage).<br>

**The Principles of Testing**

The ISTQB defines 7 fundamental testing principles to improve the effectiveness of software testing.

1️⃣ **Testing Shows the Presence of Defects, Not Their Absence**<br>
*What It Means: Testing reduces the number of defects but can never guarantee a 100% bug-free product.*

2️⃣ **Exhaustive Testing is Impossible**<br>
*What It Means: It's impractical to test every possible input/output scenario. Instead, we use risk-based testing and prioritization.*

3️⃣ **Early Testing Saves Time & Money**<br>
*What It Means: Detecting defects early in the development lifecycle (Shift-Left Testing) is cheaper and prevents larger failures later.*

4️⃣ **Defects Cluster Together** <br>
*What It Means: Most defects are found in a small portion of the application (e.g., 20% of modules cause 80% of bugs). Prioritize testing in high-risk areas.*

5️⃣ **Beware of the Pesticide Paradox**<br>
*What It Means: Running the same set of tests repeatedly eventually stops finding new defects. To overcome this, test cases should be updated and varied.*

6️⃣ **Testing is Context-Dependent**<br>
*What It Means: Different applications require different testing approaches (e.g., security testing for banking apps, usability testing for e-commerce).*

7️⃣ **Absence of Errors is a Fallacy**<br>
*What It Means: A system can be bug-free but still fail if it doesn’t meet user needs. Testing should focus on validating business requirements as well as finding defects.*
